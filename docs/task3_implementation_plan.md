# SQL Queries Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the steps to create and test SQL queries for analyzing order data, including total sales calculations, customer spending analysis, and average order value computations.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup
- [ ] Create the `orders` table with the specified schema
  - id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
  - customer (TEXT)
  - amount (REAL)
  - order_date (DATE)
- [ ] Insert the provided sample data
- [ ] Verify table creation and data insertion

### 2. Query Implementation

#### 2.1 Total Sales for March 2024
- [ ] Implement query to calculate total sales for March 2024
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify result matches expected value (27,000)

#### 2.2 Top Customer Analysis
- [ ] Implement query to find highest spending customer
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify result matches expected values:
  - Top customer: Alice
  - Total spent: 20,000

#### 2.3 Average Order Value
- [ ] Implement query to calculate average order value
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify result matches expected value (6,000)

### 3. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create test cases for each query
- [ ] Test with edge cases:
  - Empty table
  - Single record
  - Multiple records for same customer
  - Orders spanning multiple months
- [ ] Verify date handling for different formats
- [ ] Test aggregation functions accuracy

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Document each query with:
  - Purpose
  - Expected input
  - Expected output
  - Edge cases handled
- [ ] Create summary table of results
- [ ] Add comments explaining complex query logic

### 5. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Analyze query execution plans
- [ ] Consider indexing strategies for:
  - order_date (for date-based queries)
  - customer (for customer-based aggregations)
- [ ] Test query performance with larger datasets

## Success Criteria
- All queries return expected results
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Documentation is complete and clear
- Performance is acceptable for the given dataset size

## Timeline
1. Database Setup: 1 hour
2. Query Implementation: 2 hours
3. Testing: 1 hour
4. Documentation: 1 hour
5. Performance Optimization: 1 hour

Total estimated time: 6 hours
